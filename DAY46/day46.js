/**
 * OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
 * 
 * A programming paradigm that uses blueprints to create instances that represent real-life objects
 * 
 * PRINCIPLES
 * 
 *  1. Abstraction      Hiding low-level details of an implementation of a feature
 *  2. Encapsulation    Keeping some properties inaccessible to avoid accidental changes
 *  3. Inheritance      Making parent properties available in children
 *  4. Polymorphism     A child can overwrite inherited methods

 * 
 *  1. Javascript uses Prototypes, and not classes as per the usual standards of OOP
 *  2. Prototypal inheritance or delegation : It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object
 *  
 *  We can inplement prototypal inheritance in three ways
 * 
 *  a) Constructor function
 *  b) ES6 classes
 *  c) Object.create()
