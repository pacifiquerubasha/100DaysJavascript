# Welcome to Projects Phase

Congratulations for making it this far. We have finally unlocked the project phase of our challenge. In this phase we will be working on a range of projects. We will make sure we are as organised as possible by following the steps learnt in [DAY50](https://github.com/Scholaa/100DaysJavascript/blob/main/DAY50/ProjectPlan_Leaflet.md). 

We will need to also take into account best practices including conventions and code structure to be able to start off this journey wearing professional spirit. The reference to the list of projects can be found [here](https://mikkegoes.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#javascript-stopwatch)

Courage!
